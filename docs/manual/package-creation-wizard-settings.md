# Package Creation Wizard Settings

## Package Definition

![Package definition section](../images/manual/package-definition-section.webp)

Package identity, generated package structure, and package-level metadata.

### Identifier

The package identifier becomes the generated `package.json` `name` value. It also becomes:

- the repository root folder name
- the package folder name inside the repository
- the local package reference used by the companion project

Use a UPM-style identifier such as `com.company.package`.

### Package Name

This is the user-facing display name written to `package.json` as `displayName`.

It is what users see in package metadata, not the filesystem package folder name.

### Assembly Name

This value drives the generated asmdef names for the package runtime assembly and the optional editor and sample assemblies.

Examples:

- `Runtime/<Assembly Name>.asmdef`
- `Editor/<Assembly Name>.Editor.asmdef`
- `Samples~/<Assembly Name>.asmdef`

Choose a stable assembly name early. Renaming it later is a broader code migration.

### Namespace

This is the root namespace used by generated source and tokenized templates.

It is also used by the DocFX filter template through the `{{NAMESPACE_NAME}}` and `{{NAMESPACE_NAME_REGEX}}` tokens.

### Description

The short package description is written into:

- `package.json`
- tokenized templates such as generated docs landing pages and readmes

Keep it short enough to work well in manifest metadata.

### Company Name

This package-facing company value is written into generated package metadata, especially the package manifest author block when author metadata is enabled.

This field is separate from the companion project's company name.

### Include Author Metadata

When enabled, the generated `package.json` includes an `author` object.

When disabled:

- the nested `URL` field is hidden
- the nested `Email` field is hidden
- no `author` metadata is written

### URL

This optional field appears only when `Include Author Metadata` is enabled.

It is written into `package.json` as the author URL. The field supports the standard package-authoring template tokens.

### Email

This optional field appears only when `Include Author Metadata` is enabled.

It is written into `package.json` as the author email address.

### Minimum Unity Version

When enabled, the package manifest includes Unity version gating fields.

When disabled:

- the nested `Major`, `Minor`, and `Release` fields are hidden
- no minimum Unity version fields are written

### Major

The Unity major version written to the `unity` field in `package.json` when minimum Unity version support is enabled.

### Minor

The Unity minor version written to the `unity` field in `package.json` when minimum Unity version support is enabled.

The manifest combines `Major` and `Minor` as `<major>.<minor>`.

### Release

An optional Unity release suffix written to `package.json` as `unityRelease` when minimum Unity version support is enabled.

Only needed when the package manifest must target a specific Unity release suffix.

### Documentation URL

This optional value is written to `package.json` as `documentationUrl`.

The field supports the standard package-authoring template tokens, so it can be built from the current package, repository, or project values.

Leave it empty if you do not want a documentation URL in the manifest.

### Include Package README

When enabled, the wizard writes `README.md` inside the package root using the package README template.

When disabled, the package still gets `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`, but no package-level readme is generated.

### Create Documentation Folder

When enabled, the wizard creates a repository-level `docs/` scaffold that includes:

- `docs/docfx.json`
- `docs/docfx-pdf.json`
- `docs/filterConfig.yml`
- `docs/index.md`
- `docs/api/index.md`
- `docs/toc.yml`
- `docs/manual/toc.yml`
- `docs/pdf/toc.yml`
- `docs/api/.gitignore`
- `docs/.gitignore`
- optional branding images under `docs/images/`

When disabled, no `docs/` folder is created.

### Create Samples Folder

When enabled, the package gets:

- `Samples~/00-SharedSampleAssets/`
- `Samples~/01-BasicSample/`
- `Samples~/01-BasicSample/BasicSample.cs`
- `Samples~/<Assembly Name>.asmdef`

The generated `package.json` also receives a `samples` block that points at the sample folders.

When disabled, no `Samples~` folder or `samples` manifest entry is created.

### Create Editor Folder

When enabled, the package gets an `Editor/` folder plus an editor-only asmdef named `<Assembly Name>.Editor.asmdef`.

Intended for editor tooling that should live inside the generated package.

### Create Tests Folder

When enabled, the package gets a `Tests/` folder.

This also changes the companion project manifest: the package is added to the generated project's `testables` list so the package tests can run from the companion project.

### Dependencies

This list writes package dependencies into the generated `package.json`.

The dependency editor supports:

- add, remove, and reorder operations
- package-name autocomplete backed by the shared package search cache
- direct version entry

Each row contains:

- `Package name`: expected to be lowercase
- `Version`: expected to follow SemVer, such as `1.0.0-preview.1`

If the current package name does not yet match a known exact package, the row can expand to show suggestions.

## Repo Settings

![Repository settings section](../images/manual/repo-settings-section.webp)

Repository-root files and repository initialization behavior outside the package folder itself.

### Copyright Holder

This value is used by generated repository-level copyright and license content.

If you generate an SPDX license template, it becomes the copyright holder in that file.

### Include README

When enabled, the wizard creates a repository root `README.md` using the repository README template.

This is separate from the package README toggle in `Package Definition`.

### Open Source License

This controls the generated `LICENSE` file at the repository root.

The available values are:

- `None`: no license file is generated
- `Custom`: uses the editable custom license template
- `MIT`
- `Apache-2.0`
- `BSD-3-Clause`

### Initialize Git Repository

When enabled, the wizard runs repository initialization after the files are written.

That process creates the git repository in the generated root and creates the initial commit.

When disabled:

- no git repository is initialized
- the nested `Remote URL` field is hidden

### Remote URL

This optional field appears only when `Initialize Git Repository` is enabled.

If provided, it is resolved through the standard template-token system and then assigned to the generated repository's `origin` remote.

## Companion Project

The `Companion Project` section uses the shared project settings UI, but inside the package creation wizard it intentionally hides the target location field because the companion project always lives inside the generated repository.

![Companion project section](../images/manual/companion-project-section.webp)

Unity project settings for the generated companion project used for development, validation, and sample usage.

### Company Name

This company value is written into the generated Unity project's settings.

It is also available to tokenized templates as the project company value.

### Project Name

This determines the companion project folder name under `projects/`.

It is also used as the generated Unity product name.

### Version

This single version value is reused across the generated output:

- the package manifest version
- the generated Unity project version
- tokenized templates that reference package version

### Included Packages

This foldout controls package additions for the generated companion project manifest.

When expanded, it contains:

- `Preferred Editor`
- the `Included Packages` list
- a reminder that these packages are added on top of the template project's baseline manifest

Collapsed state only hides the fields. It does not disable previously set values.

### Preferred Editor

This selects which Unity IDE integration package is added to the generated project manifest.

The choices are:

- `None`
- `Visual Studio`
- `Visual Studio Code`
- `Rider`

The generated project manifest removes any preexisting IDE packages from the baseline manifest and adds the selected one back.

### Included Packages List

These entries are merged into the generated companion project manifest after the baseline manifest and preferred editor dependency are applied.

Adds packages beyond the template project's baseline setup.

### Advanced

This foldout groups lower-frequency project options.

Collapsed state hides the contained fields but preserves their values.

### Generate AGENTS.md

When enabled, the wizard writes a repository root `AGENTS.md` file using the repository AGENTS template.

When disabled, no `AGENTS.md` file is created.

### Auto-Open After Creation

This toggle sits at the bottom of the companion-project section.

When enabled, the wizard attempts to open the generated companion project in the current Unity editor after generation completes.

When disabled, the files are still generated, but the wizard does not launch the project.

## Output

The `Output` section is read-only except for `Target Location`.

![Output section and repository layout preview](../images/manual/output-and-preview-section.webp)

It shows:

- `Target Location`
- `Repository Root`
- `Package Folder`
- `Companion Project`

`Target Location` is the base output folder. The final repository root is computed as:

`<Target Location>/<Identifier>`

The package folder is then:

`<Target Location>/<Identifier>/<Identifier>`

The companion project folder is:

`<Target Location>/<Identifier>/projects/<Project Name>`

## Repository Layout Preview

The live repository layout preview is not just decoration. It reflects the current toggle state and helps confirm which files and folders each setting will add or remove.

![Repository layout preview detail](../images/manual/repository-layout-preview-detail.webp)

Hovering related fields in the form highlights the matching area of the preview, including package metadata, docs, readmes, samples, editor files, tests, and companion-project output.
